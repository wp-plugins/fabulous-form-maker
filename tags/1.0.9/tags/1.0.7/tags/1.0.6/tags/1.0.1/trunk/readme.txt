== Installation ==

1. Follow the typical [WordPress plugin installation steps](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins)
2. If you are unfamiliar with shortcode usage, [learn about shortcodes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API)
3. After installing, on the admin menu, visit the new link under "Pages" titled "Contact Form"
4. Change the default settings if needed and create the form on there.
5. Call the form whereever needed by using the shortcode.  NOTE: This plugin can be called multiple times on the website; however, only once per page.

**IMPORTANT!**

* When adding shortcodes to pages or posts be sure to USE THE WORDPRESS HTML EDITOR VIEW, not the Visual editor view.
* Prior to plugin updates its always a good idea to backup event data. Select a plugin from the WordPress Plugins Repository that can backup and restore custom (non-WordPress) tables.
