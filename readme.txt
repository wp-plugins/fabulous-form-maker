== Developers ==
As of version 2.0, this plugin is now extensible without modifying source code.  This plugin can be extended to work on multiple Content Mangement Systems.  Additionally, the CSS can all be overrided (see FAQ).  

= Extending the plugin for other CMS =
1. An adapter needs to be created for the CMS you wish to extend this plugin for. The adapter must implement /FM/I_Adapter.  
2. The adapter should follow a namespacing pattern such as \FM\MyCMSName. See the WordPress Adapter (default adapter) for an example.  
3. The directory structure must **exactly** match the namespace, case-sensitivity included (see again the WordPress adapter for an example).  
4. Update the config.json file such that the object adapter now specifies the directory (sub-namespace) for your adapter.
5. Additionally, if your CMS needs support that is separate from the adapter, create a file called support.php inside the sub-namespace directory. See the WordPress adapter as an example.
