== Description ==

A custom form maker that allows users to build their own forms easily and without any knowledge of coding or progamming. Users can create text boxes, passwords fields, drop down select boxes, radio boxes, checkboxes, and text areas.  Once the plugin is activated, the form and its settings can be found and edited under the "Pages" menu.  Call the form by using the shortcode [etm_contact_form].  


NOTE: This plugin currently supports only one form per website.
<br>This plugin does not support WordPress MU.

= Support =
* [Read about installation instructions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/fabulous-form-maker/installation)
* [Submit issues to the author](mailto:iwork@ellytronic.com)

=  Features =
* Users can add a variety of input boxes, textareas, and select boxes.
* Users can completely style form elements by calling the form id before the targeted elements in their CSS.
* Supports required textboxes and password fields.

== Installation ==

1. Follow the typical [WordPress plugin installation steps](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins)
2. If you are unfamiliar with shortcode usage, [learn about shortcodes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API)
3. After installing, on the admin menu, visit the new link under "Pages" titled "Contact Form"
4. Change the default settings if needed and create the form on there.
5. Call the form whereever needed by using the shortcode.  NOTE: This plugin can be called multiple times on the website; however, only once per page.

**IMPORTANT!**

* When adding shortcodes to pages or posts be sure to USE THE WORDPRESS HTML EDITOR VIEW, not the Visual editor view.
* Prior to plugin updates its always a good idea to backup event data. Select a plugin from the WordPress Plugins Repository that can backup and restore custom (non-WordPress) tables.
